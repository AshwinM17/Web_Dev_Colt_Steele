    <h1>Marvel Cinematic Universe</h1>
    <p>
        The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an <a href="#sdasd">American without underline</a> a franchise and shared
        universe centered on a series of
        superhero films produced by Marvel Studios. The films are based on characters that appear in American comic
        books published by Marvel Comics. The franchise also includes television series, short films, digital series,
        and literature. The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by
        crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters.

        Marvel Studios releases its films in groups called "Phases", with the first three phases collectively known as
        "The Infinity Saga" and the following three phases as "The Multiverse Saga". The first MCU film, Iron Man
        (2008), began Phase One, which culminated in the 2012 crossover film The Avengers. Phase Two began with Iron Man
        3 (2013) and concluded with Ant-Man (2015). Phase Three began with Captain America: Civil War (2016) and
        concluded with Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). Phase Four began with Black Widow (2021) and concluded with
        Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022). Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) began Phase Five, which will end
        with Captain America: Brave New World (2025), and Phase Six will begin with Fantastic Four (2025). Phase Six and
        "The Multiverse Saga" will conclude with Avengers 5 (2026) and Avengers: Secret Wars (2027).

    <h2>Development</h2>
    <div>
        By 2005, Marvel Entertainment had begun planning to produce its own films independently and distribute them
        through Paramount Pictures.[2] Previously, Marvel had co-produced several superhero films with Columbia
        Pictures, New Line Cinema and others, including a seven-year development deal with 20th Century Fox.[3] Marvel
        made relatively little profit from its licensing deals with other studios and wanted to get more money out of
        its films while maintaining artistic control of the projects and distribution.[4] Avi Arad, head of Marvel's
        film division, was pleased with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films at Sony Pictures, but was less pleased with others.
        As a result, Arad decided to form Marvel Studios, Hollywood's first major independent film studio since
        DreamWorks Pictures. Kevin Feige, Arad's second-in-command,[5] realized that unlike Spider-Man, Blade, and the
        X-Men, whose film rights were licensed to Sony, New Line Cinema, and Fox, respectively, Marvel still owned the
        rights to the core members of the Avengers. Feige, a self-described "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared
        universe, just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.[6]
